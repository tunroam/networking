# Networking

First install the github.com/tunroam/networking
after which you can run `./install.sh`.

Conclude with either Bridge or NAT.
We only tested NAT, since we'll use that for the demo at UvA.
TODO make this actually work, not a one lucky shot

## TODO

- systemd: after boot configure networking (default route etc.)
- further debugging
